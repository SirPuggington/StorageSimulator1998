Welcome to Storage Simulator 1998.

How To Play:

You are the manger of a small storage unit. You have access to one high bay storage rack.
The storage rack has three rows, with 4 slots each. Each slot can fit two pallets behind each other.
The back pallet can not be reached when there is another pallet in front of it.


ORDERS:
You will receive orders by clicking one of the "New Order" buttons.
Each order will either be incoming, meaning the product will need to be placed in an empty slot of the rack,
or outgoing, meaning the product must be taken out of the Rack.
Each order will reward a different amount of money once fulfilled.
It is possible to keep up to three orders pending simultaneously.

PRODUCTS:
Your orders can contain a variety of different products, some of which have special requirements:
Wooden beams are too long for a single slot and will require two empty slots behind each other.
Heavy stone will need to be placed in the bottom row.
Medium stone can not be placed in the top row.

MOVING AND SCRAPPING:
It is possible to move pallets for the price of 100$ by activating the "Move" mode.

Orders can also be rejected by clicking the "Reject Current Order" button
